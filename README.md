# Flask-template-inheritance
Assignment_3

This Flask web application consists of two main routes: Home (/) and About (/about). It uses template inheritance to maintain a consistent layout across pages via a base.html file, which includes a styled header, footer, and navigation menu. The home.html and about.html templates extend this base layout and define their own titles and content blocks. The Home page introduces the website, while the About page highlights the organization's identity as a top web development company. The design is simple, using embedded CSS for layout and formatting. This structure demonstrates clean, modular web development using Flask and Jinja2 templating.
